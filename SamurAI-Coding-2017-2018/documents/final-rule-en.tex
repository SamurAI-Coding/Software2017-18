\section{Outline}

The final round tournament is organized as a single-elimination
knockout tournament with 16 participating teams, with an additional
third-place playoff.

Each of the tournament matches is a single game (two races on the same
race course exchanging the start position).  When the game is a draw,
an extra game with a different race course is played.  When the
extra game is a draw again, the team seeded higher will proceed.

The tournament is conducted as shown in the bracket on the right.  The
numbers in squares are the seeding ranks of the participating teams.

\section{Race Courses}
Race courses used in the final round satisfy the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item The course length is between 100 and 200, inclusive.
\item The course width is between 2 and 20, inclusive.
\item The vision limit is greater than or equal to 5.
\item The initial remaining time is 200ms times the step limit plus 1000ms.
\end{itemize}

All eight games of the first round use the same race course,
as well as four games of the quarter-final games,
two games of the semifinal games,
and two games of the final and the third-place playoff.

\section{Seeding}
Seeding is based on team ranks resulting from the preliminary round
tournament, as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Teams with top-ranked teams in the preliminary round tournament are
  seeded first in the order of their ranks.
\item
  Teams specially selected by the IPSJ Programming Contest Committee
  taking diversity and geographical distribution in consideration are
  seeded next in the order of their ranks in the preliminary round
  tournament.
\end{itemize}
When more than one teams are ranked the same, their seed orders are
decided by drawing lots.
